# ansible
An area where I store my Ansible playbooks.
These will be set up for Linux systems.  Intending to stay as distro agnostic as possible.

## Introduction
In order to use these files effectively you will need to make a Ansible vault called secrets.yml to store  variables with your information.  
For instructions on how to make one of these see [Ansible's documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.4/vault.html#creating-encrypted-files).
* ansible_ssh_user - The user to log into the remote systems as.
* ssh_key_location - The location of the ssh public key(s) to install.

## Bootstrap
This is intended to get a node off the ground.  Allowing you to more easily run further playbooks.
* Installs and enables Avahi, and SSH.
* Disables root login, and password authentication for ssh.
* Adds your user with sudo permissions (no prompt), and your public key installed.
Recommended to run as: 

    ``ansible-playbook --ask-pass --ask-sudo-pass --ask-vault-pass -i '1.1.1.1,' bootstrap.yml``
